Hospital-Data-Monitoring-Archival-System

Archiving Process:

IMPORTANT: I modified the python simulators log directory named from LOG_DIR = "active_logs"  to LOG_DIR=hospital/active_logs" this was messing up the structure of the system.


NOTE: run the designated simulutor before running the program

Program Prompts the user for log to archive,
Based on user's input(choice) the program logs the file corresponding to the choice of the user into the active logs dir
The program also takes the file corresponding to the user's input(choice) into the archive directory with the timestamp
In case the program can not find the file it throws an error
But in case its successfull it prints a success message to the user
